DS | Unit Project 2

### PROMPT

In this project, you will implement the exploratory analysis plan developed in Project 1. This will lay the groundwork for our first modeling exercise in Project 3.

Before completing an analysis, it is critical to understand your data. You will need to identify all the biases and variables in your model in order to accurately assess the strengths and limitations of your analysis and predictions.

Following these steps will help you better understand your dataset.

**Goal:** A Jupyter notebook writeup that provides a dataset overview with visualizations and statistical analysis.

### DELIVERABLES

#### Jupyter Notebook Exploratory Analysis

- **Requirements:**
  - Read in your dataset, determine how many samples are present, and ID any missing data
  - Create a table of descriptive statistics for each of the variables (n, mean, median, standard deviation)
  - Describe the distributions of your data
  - Plot box plots for each variable
  - Create a covariance matrix
  - Determine any issues or limitations, based on your exploratory analysis

- **Bonus:**
    - Replace missing values using the median replacement method
    - Log transform data to meet normality requirements
    - Advanced Option: Replace missing values using multiple imputation methods

- **Submission:**
    - Thursday April 5
    
- **Dataset**
  - You may use the `admissions.csv` dataset from our last assignment or choose a different dataset that we've encountered in class.
